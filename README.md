# Page View Time Series Visualizer  

This project uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to analyze and visualize time series data of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum (from **May 2016** to **December 2019**). The visualizations help identify patterns in website traffic, including long-term trends, monthly averages, and seasonal variation.  

## Analysis Includes  

- **Data cleaning**: filtering out the top and bottom 2.5% of page view outliers  
- **Line plot**: visualizing overall page views over time  
- **Bar plot**: showing the average daily page views for each month grouped by year  
- **Box plots**:  
  - *Year-wise* box plot to highlight long-term trends  
  - *Month-wise* box plot to explore seasonal patterns
